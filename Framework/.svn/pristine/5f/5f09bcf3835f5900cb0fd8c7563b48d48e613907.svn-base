Among the tables are two couples, a few high schoolers already looking bored with summer vacation, and lots of families, about half of which are Chinese-American. Rambunctious little ones nibble on scallion pancakes and juicy pork dumplings. Their parents slurp thick noodles from a shared steaming hot pot. Service is attentive, restrooms clean, parking a breeze. </p><p class='article-p'>What brought us here in the first place are the dumplings. Soup dumplings, which on the menu appear as pork mini juicy dumplings ($6.75) are on the first visit slouchy, plump perfection, just bursting with rich broth and tender meat. On another visit, they are slightly overcooked, some of the soup has seeped out, and the meat is the tiniest bit tensed up from a few minutes too long in the steamer. Still delicious and that doesn&rsquo;t stop us from polishing them off. We order pork and chive dumplings ($6.25) fried &mdash; you can get them steamed, but you&rsquo;ll miss out on that beautiful golden crust. Either way, the not-too-thick skins are in perfect proportion to the porky, oniony centers. Shandong pan-fried dumplings ($6.25) are garlicky, generous, pork-filled crescents. Good luck picking a favorite.</p>"

That means the happiest person in Hollywood this morning isn't actual Emmy host Neil Patrick Harris, whose celebrated podium charm replaced Mara at the last minute.</p><p class='article-p'>It's Reed Hastings. This was exactly the outcome the Netflix CEO was envisioning when he outbid HBO for 24 episodes of the David Fincher–helmed Cards. Hastings knew his company needed the strong appearance of quality, if not the thing itself, in order to get attention and respect from a dubious industry. Regardless of whether Netflix actually goes home with any awards on September 22 — Jason Bateman was also nominated for Arrested Development; I have a feeling Spacey is taking the trophy — Hastings has successfully evolved his company from red envelopes to the red carpet.</p>"
